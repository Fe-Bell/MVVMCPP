# MVVMCPP
Open source library for C++ applications using MVVM pattern.

This implementation is loosely based on MvvmLight and CommunityToolkitMvvm, originally written in C#.

MVVMCPP is written with modern C++11 and can be directly included in supporting projects, or by statically linking to MVVMCPPLIB.lib.
